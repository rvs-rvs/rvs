## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-22

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Worktree Detached HEAD Mode
- **Fixed Index Management**: Resolved issues with index state in detached HEAD mode
  - `checkout` command now properly updates index to match checked-out commit
  - Fixed index synchronization when switching to detached HEAD state
  - Ensures working tree and index are consistent after checkout operations

- **Improved Uncommitted Changes Detection**: Enhanced logic for detecting uncommitted changes
  - Better handling of repositories with no commits yet
  - Proper comparison between staged files and committed files
  - More accurate detection of working tree modifications

- **Worktree Status Display**: Fixed status output in detached HEAD mode
  - Detached HEAD now shows "Not currently on any branch." in worktrees
  - Main repository shows "HEAD detached at [commit]" format
  - Consistent with Git's status behavior

- **Worktree Listing Improvements**: Enhanced worktree list command output
  - Detached HEAD worktrees now show "(detached HEAD)" instead of "[detached]"
  - Added worktree file to store actual worktree path for accurate listing
  - Better path resolution for worktree metadata

- **Commit Operations in Detached HEAD**: Fixed commit behavior in detached HEAD state
  - Commits in detached HEAD now properly update HEAD reference
  - Index correctly reflects committed state after detached HEAD commits
  - Maintains Git-compatible behavior for detached HEAD workflows

- **Log Display**: Improved commit log formatting for detached HEAD
  - Shows "(HEAD)" for detached HEAD state instead of branch reference
  - Proper branch annotation for commits pointed to by branches
  - Consistent formatting between oneline and full log modes

- **Error Message Consistency**: Updated merge error messages to match Git format
  - Changed "Not a valid commit" to "merge: [ref] - not something we can merge"
  - Maintains compatibility with Git's error message format

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Path Normalization**: Enhanced path handling to remove leading "./" prefixes
- **Index State Management**: More robust index loading and saving operations
- **Worktree Metadata**: Added worktree file for better path tracking
- **Error Handling**: Improved exception handling in checkout and index operations

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-21

### üéâ Major Features Added

#### Git-like Worktree Implementation
- **Complete Worktree Support**: Implemented full Git-compatible worktree functionality
  - `rvs worktree add <path> <commit>` - Create new worktrees
  - `rvs worktree list` - List all worktrees
  - `rvs worktree remove <path>` - Remove worktrees
  - `rvs worktree lock/unlock <path>` - Lock/unlock worktrees
- **Git-compatible File Structure**: 
  - Worktrees now use `.rvs` **file** (not directory) containing `rvsdir: /path/to/metadata`
  - Metadata stored in main repo at `.rvs/worktrees/worktree-name/`
  - Exactly matches Git's worktree behavior

#### New Git Commands
- **`rvs show`**: Display commit information with multiple output formats
  - `rvs show <commit> --name-status` - Show file changes with status
  - `rvs show <commit> --name-only` - Show only changed file names
  - `rvs show <commit> --stat` - Show diffstat information
- **`rvs diff-tree`**: Compare tree objects
  - `rvs diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r <commit>` - Git-compatible tree comparison
  - Support for comparing commits with their parents
- **`rvs reset`**: Reset HEAD, index, and working tree
  - `rvs reset --soft <commit>` - Reset only HEAD
  - `rvs reset --mixed <commit>` - Reset HEAD and index (default)
  - `rvs reset --hard <commit>` - Reset HEAD, index, and working tree
  - `rvs reset HEAD~<n>` - Support for ancestor commit syntax

#### Enhanced Checkout Command
- **Branch Creation**: `rvs checkout -b <branch>` - Create and switch to new branch
- **Force Branch Creation**: `rvs checkout -B <branch>` - Create/reset and switch to branch
- **Detached HEAD**: `rvs checkout --detach <commit>` - Checkout in detached HEAD state
- **Path Checkout**: `rvs checkout <commit> -- <files>` - Checkout specific files

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Path Normalization
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Fixed file path handling for Windows/Linux/macOS
- **Git-like Path Handling**: 
  - `./example.txt` now correctly normalizes to `example.txt`
  - Eliminates duplicate file entries in status output
  - Consistent forward-slash usage across platforms
- **Relative Path Resolution**: Properly handles complex paths like `./subdir/../file.txt`

#### Worktree Infrastructure
- **Repository Detection**: Automatically detects worktrees vs main repositories
- **Index Management**: Separate index files for each worktree
- **HEAD Management**: Independent HEAD pointers for each worktree
- **Status Command**: Full worktree support with correct branch detection

#### Code Quality
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and edge case handling
- **File Operations**: Robust file cleanup and restoration
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across operating systems

### üéØ Git Compatibility

#### Command Parity
All new commands produce output identical to Git:
- Status indicators (A, M, D) match Git format
- Error messages sent to stderr appropriately
- Success messages formatted like Git
- Command-line arguments and options match Git syntax

#### Workflow Support
- **Detached HEAD Workflows**: Full support for detached HEAD operations
- **Branch Management**: Create branches from any commit or detached HEAD
- **File Operations**: Checkout, reset, and restore operations work identically to Git
- **Multi-worktree Development**: Complete support for multiple working directories

### üì¶ Version Update
- **Version Bump**: Updated from 2.0.3 to 2.1.0
- **PyPI Compatibility**: Ready for automatic publishing via GitHub Actions

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed `.rvs` file being removed during checkout operations
- Corrected worktree status showing "No commits yet" in detached HEAD
- Resolved path normalization issues causing duplicate file entries
- Fixed index loading/saving in worktree environments

### üîÑ Breaking Changes
- Worktree `.rvs` structure changed from directory to file (automatic migration)
- Path normalization may affect scripts relying on non-normalized paths
